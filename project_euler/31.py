# I think we should start with the coin with the highest value and move towards the coin with the smallest.
# 2 * 1 pound, 
# 1*1 pound + 4*50p, 
# 1*1 pound + 3*50p + 


# Lets simplify and think of the 2 pound and 1 pound as 200p and 100p respectively.
# Lets simplify further and not mention the p, and thereby only talking about the numbers.
# Then the question is; how many combinations are possible of 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, and 1 to create 200?

# 200/100 = 2
# 200/50 = 4

# x = 1, y = 2, combinations 1 (2*1)
# x = 1, y = 5, combinations 1 (5*1)
# x = 1, y = 10, combination 1 (*5)  
# x = 1, y = 20, combination 1 (2*10)  
# x = 1, y = 50, combination 1 (2*20 + 10)?  
# x = 1, y = 100, combination 1 (2*50)  
# x = 1, y = 200, combination 1 (2*100)  


# x = 2, y = 5, combination 1 (2*2 + 1)?
# x = 5, y = 10, combination 1 (2*5)  
# x = 10, y = 20, combination 1 (2*10)  
# x = 20, y = 50, combination 1 (2*20 + 10)?  
# x = 50, y = 100, combination 1 (2*50)  
# x = 100, y = 200, combination 1 (2*100)  


# How many ways can you make 100
